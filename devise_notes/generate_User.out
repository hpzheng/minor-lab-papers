[DEVISE] Devise.case_insensitive_keys is false which is no longer supported. If you want to continue running on this mode, please ensure you are not using validatable (you can copy the validations directly to your model) and set case_insensitive_keys to an empty array.


[DEVISE] Devise.use_salt_as_remember_token is false which is no longer supported. Devise now only uses the salt as remember token and the remember_token column can be removed from your models.


[DEVISE] Devise.reset_password_within is nil. Please set this value to an interval (for example, 6.hours) and add a reset_password_sent_at field to your Devise models (if they don't have one already).
